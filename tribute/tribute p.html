    <p>
      Albert Einstein was a theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity. Born in Germany in 1879, he made significant contributions to the scientific community, particularly in the field of physics.

    <p>
      Einstein's theory of relativity revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity. His famous equation, E=mc^2, describes the equivalence of energy (E) and mass (m) and laid the foundation for nuclear energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Einstein received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his explanation of the photoelectric effect. His work continues to influence scientific research and has had a profound impact on our modern understanding of the universe.
